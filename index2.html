							<h2><span> RMB City: A Second Life City Planning</span></h2>
							<div><p>Cao Fei, 2007<a href="https://anthology.rhizome.org/rmb-city"><br>
								<br>Cao Fei uses Second Life as an online space to create a virtual world and convey themes of modernization and consumer culture. Fei explores China’s modernization and its utopic vision. This digital work of art explores the ways in which global communication impacts imagination. This virtual reality celebrates the interplay between real and fictional worlds. Fei creates a utopian culture that vividly reflects the digital realm and youth in the 21st century.</a></p></div></figcaption>

							<h2><span>Gropius Landscape, Master's House</span></h2>
							<div><p>Julie Langsam, 2014<a href="https://www.artsy.net/artwork/julie-langsam-gropius-landscape-masters-house"><br> <br>Langsam explores utopia as yearning for the past. Langsam conducts a dialogue with history to create imaginary landscapes. She focuses on creating legacies for the modernist forms centred around the Bauhaus in Germany. Langsam paints utopian structures designed by Gropius, Johnson, and Le Corbusier. These buildings once held promise for the future but today these modernist structures cease to uphold the same promise. The once monumental buildings are overcast with a constardicting sky. Langsam creates a portrait of utopia’s afterlife.</a></p></div></figcaption>

							<h2><span>Spectral Disco</span></h2>
							<div><p>Tala Madani, 2020 <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artwork/tala-madani-spectral-disco"><br><br>Madani creates a metaphysical disco that forces us to question visual perception, while revealing the underbelly of human relationships. A disco and clubbing culture represents this utopic realm and euphoric feeling. Yet when a vulnerable baby is placed within this space crawling around helplessly and confused among distorted fading figures we understand the idea that Madani evokes. Throughout this place with streaming lights and a place for enjoyment there is still no clarity and we remain in a vulnerable. This painting sheds light on how even utopias can become dystopian when we view them through the narrative of displacement. Is it a utopia because of our broken vision?</a></p></div></figcaption>

							<h2><span>Munuwata Sky</span></h2>
							<div><p>Wolfgang Tillman, 2011<a href="http://www.artnet.com/artists/wolfgang-tillmans/munuwata-sky-UcdJF55zuSMaoGe7Vc5ipg2"><br><br>Tillman uses photography to subvert a utopian ideal of togetherness. This image combines questions about both a utopia and dystopia. With this still and vast image with no figures and the sky as the subject matter Tillman utilizes this hyper digital HD medium to increase our attentiveness of the world. Yet he also proposes that we take things for granted as this new realm of HD has changed our perception of the world. Tillman was also open about how most of his work has been made with the knowledge of possible death because he has been battling AIDS since 1983. With death in the back of his mind with this dark yet hopeful image he questions if this is how living together could be: being peaceful together and enjoying the senses and vastness of the universe where we all situated together.</a></p></div></figcaption>

							<h2><span>Golden Retreat</span></h2>
							<div><p>Terry Pauline Price, 2019<a href="https://www.artsy.net/artwork/terry-pauline-price-golden-retreat"><br><br>Price depicts youth in a romantic utopic manner. Price’s brush strokes are very gestural and energetic, reminiscent of an impressionist painting. The use of a vibrant and warm color palette illustrates joyful and a warm environment. This painting highlights utopia as an escape to better times whether it is the past or in the future. The young female figure is free to explore nature this sense of freedom and connection to nature is accompanied by the soft and virbat style of brush strokes that creates a sense of utopic timelessness. </a></p></div></figcaption>

							<h2><span>El Fin Del Mundo (The End of The World)</span></h2>
							<div><p>Moon Kyungwon & Jeon Joonho, 2012<a href="https://vimeo.com/channels/271891/69773881"><br><br>This video installation focuses on a lone survivor in an apolycalic disaster. It focuses on the mental state in relation to dystopia. How can our mentality be compromised and manipulated? It explores how corporate power can engulf us and take away human connection and emotion and replace it with consumer goods. This dystopian future shows a humanity that is predominantly absent. Reminiscent of the sci-fi film genre this dystopian storyline ultimately questions the role of humanity and art in a changing world with an uncertain future. How will corporate power and a consumer society affect our human condition? </a></p></div></figcaption>

							<h2><span>Machine Hallucinations</span></h2>
							<div><p>Refik Anadol, 2019<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksXoSz52sug"><br><br>Anadol researched machine algorithms and worked with one of the largest data sets in the world of nature. He trained a neural network with 70 million photos available from around the world and then created an AI that streams nature. Time and space are the main materials. When you stand in front of this beautiful enigmatic movement of color and forms surrounding you on all walls the viewer can feel as if they are in an alternate reality, a utopian one. The complicated process behind this digital creation probes Anadol to ask what will happen if AI can simulate nature for us? What will happen when AI and quantum mechanics interferes with humanity? Who will define what is real? This artwork is visually utopic, however it is subverted by the reality of technology behind its creation. Anadol brings to light that free will is already in the control of machines and systems. Free will is simple to manipulate and so are systems. The title Machine Hallucinations questions machines consciousness and questions how long term dystopian realities can hide themselves behind short term utopian alternate realities/simulations or hallucinations. </a></p></div></figcaption>

							<h2><span>A Mercy (after T. Morrison)</span></h2>
							<div><p>Julie Mehretu, 2019-2020<a href="https://www.mariangoodman.com/exhibitions/julie-mehretu-new-york-about-the-space-of-half-an-hour/"><br><br>Mehretu recalls the Book of Revelation and the narrative of the Seven Seals of God that eventually lead to the beginning of the apocalypse. In this subliminal mediation of reality dystopia is explored through the reality that is it's impossible to frame or stop time. There are only moments before and after. Irreversibility is a burden and consequence one comes to face with in a dystopian reality. She evokes a state of deconstruction and chaos. This painting was completed during the COVID19 pandemic. This new state of isolation felt close to an apocalypse with thousands of people falling ill and passing without any seeming control. A reality where there is nothing one can do except wait.</a></p></figcaption>

							<h2><span>The Dream</span></h2>
							<div><p>Henri Rousseau, 1910<a href="https://www.moma.org/collection/works/79277"><br><br>French post-impressionist painter, Rousseau depicts a nude woman lounging and dreaming. She transcends reality and travels to a surreal jungle. The dreamlike quality of the painting conveys the projection of the mind of the artist and woman. This surreal portrait of a landscape of a lush jungle with animals is filled with life. Rousseau explores the theme of utopia through the lens of primitivism in the 20th century in Paris. Rousseau paints a dream and projection of his imagination of forgein places as a way to espace modernity in Paris and enjoy the nature of this imaginary jungle.</a></p></div></figcaption>

							<h2><span>MUGEN</span></h2>
							<div><p>Masatake Kozaki, 2020<a href="http://artfrontgallery.com/en/exhibition/archive/2020_09/4330.html"><br><br>Kozaki depicts a utopian world combining both Western and Japanese techniques of collaged gold leaf and  mineral pigments. These materials give a glimmer of hope and vibrancy in this painting. Kozaki further extends this utopian world with futuristic plants and creatures to create a full picture of coexistence. The utopia depicted here is linked to the hope, desire, and appreciation of human creativity. Merging cultures and creativity are the key to this utopian reality. </a></p></div></figcaption>
